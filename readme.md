- Interactive session management with user feedback

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- NumPy

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `setup.bat` to create a virtual environment and install dependencies
3. Use `run.bat` to start an interactive session with the AI character

## Usage
